****This Python project demonstrates how to retrieve and visualize real-time weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API. The script begins by specifying a city (in this case, Bengaluru) and sending a GET request to the API using the requests library. The response, received in JSON format, contains various weather parameters such as temperature, humidity, pressure, and a brief textual description of the current weather condition.
Modules which are used are requests: for fetching live weather data via API,datetime: to display the current timestamp,matplotlib.pyplot: For data visualization (charts and graphs).
After extracting the relevant data, the script prints the weather information along with the current date and time, providing a snapshot of the local weather conditions.To enhance understanding, the weather metrics are visualized using the matplotlib library. Three types of charts are generated:
A bar chart that clearly compares temperature, humidity, and pressure, a line chart to show variation across these metrics , and a pie chart to illustrate the proportion of each parameter in relation to the total.****
